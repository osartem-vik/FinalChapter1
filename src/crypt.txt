Days of the week
There are seven days of the week, or uniquely named 24-hour periods
designed to provide scheduling context and make time more easily measureable.
Each of these days is identifiable by specific plans, moods, and tones.

Monday is viewed by many to be the "worst" day of the week, as it marks
the return to work following the weekend, when most full-time employees
are given two days off. Most students attend school in the morning and
return home in the afternoon (usually from about eight until three or
seven until two), and most workers go to work in the morning and return
home in the evening (usually from nine to five or eight to four).

Tuesday is the second day of the week, and is in many ways similar to
Monday. Not a whole lot of changes, schedule-wise, between Tuesday
and Monday; most individuals go to school or work and return home
to watch television, play video games, make plans with friends,
spend time with family, read, or engage in a similar leisure-related activity.
